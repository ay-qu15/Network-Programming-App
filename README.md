This is the code for a Network-Programming application in Java that utilizes the TCP protocol for reliable communication between Server and CLienets, both implement multithreading plus buffering on two levels for 
efficient communication.
a slight issue in the CLient code which i couldnt solve was with making the client wait for 5 minutes if the Doctor who is also a client didn't respond to him immediately.
